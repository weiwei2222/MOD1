/* Declare a function 'OrderedList', which takes in no arguments and returns an instance of an 'OrderedList' object 
when invoked with the 'new' keyword. OrderedList objects should function similarly to arrays - i.e. 
they will store values at numbered indexes, starting at 0. However, all elements are in sorted order.
All OrderedList objects should contain their own 'length' property, 
which keeps track of the number of items they contain. An OrderedList 
should also keep track of whether it is sorted in reverse order with a isReversed property. 
When an OrderedList is first created, it should have a length of 0 and an isReversed value of false. */
